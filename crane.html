    <p>The orizuru (折鶴 ori- "folded," tsuru "crane"), or paper crane, is a design that is considered to be the most classic of all Japanese origami.[1][2] In Japanese culture, it is believed that its wings carry souls up to paradise, [2] and it is a representation of the Japanese red-crowned crane, referred to as the "Honourable Lord Crane" in Japanese culture. It is often used as a ceremonial wrapper or restaurant table decoration.[3] A thousand orizuru strung together is called senbazuru (千羽鶴), meaning "thousand cranes", and it is said that if someone folds a thousand cranes, they are granted one wish.[4] The significance of this is featured in Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes, a classic story based on the life of Sadako Sasaki.
